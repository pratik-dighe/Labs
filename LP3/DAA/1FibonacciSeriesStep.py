Fibonacci Series using Iteration and Recursion
// Iteration :
// Time Complexity = O(N)
// Space Complexity : O(1)
// Recursion :
// Time Complexity : O(1.618^N)
// Space Complexity : O(N) due to Auxilliary Stack Space
// Time Complexity is derived using Binet's Formula
// Time Complexity = 1/root(5)*[(1+root(5)/2)^n-(1-root(5)/2)^n]

The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, 
typically starting with 0 and 1
0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,â€¦

Each term is calculated as: F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)

with the initial conditions: F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1

Example:
F(2)=F(1)+F(0)=1+0=1
F(3)=F(2)+F(1)=1+1=2
F(4)=F(3)+F(2)=2+1=3
F(5)=F(4)+F(3)=3+2=5

Recursion: 
A function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem until a base condition is met. 
It breaks down problems into simpler sub-problems, often resulting in a function stack.

Iteration: 
A set of instructions repeatedly executes within a loop (e.g., for, while) until a condition is no longer met. 
It directly repeats tasks without additional function calls.
